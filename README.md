# Hello, GitHub! 👋

I'm a **Product Manager** by day, **rogue coder** by night, based in the bustling tech hub of São Paulo, Brazil. 🇧🇷

By day, I'm busy driving product visions, communicating with stakeholders, and tackling user experiences head on. But when the night falls (or when my meetings are canceled), you can find me buried deep in the trenches of code, learning and loving the art of web development. 💻

Why, you might ask? To speak the lingo of my awesome dev team, understand the magic behind the curtain, and add a little bit more techie ⚡ to my PM skills.

Coding, for now, is my hobby (also my secret superpower in making). Here, you'll find a collection of my fledgling projects - they might be small, but each one has a pinch of love, a dash of curiosity, and a lot of `console.log()` statements. 😅

Remember, in a world where you can be anything, be the **Product Manager who codes**! Catch you on the `commit` side. 💪

P.S. If you don't find me here, I'm probably sipping a Caipirinha on a beach somewhere! 🍹

# Hello, GitHub! 👋

I'm a **Product Manager** by day, **"amateur" coder** by night, based in the vibrant tech hub of São Paulo, Brazil. 🇧🇷

By day, I'm busy driving product visions, communicating with stakeholders, and tackling user experiences head on. When I'm not PMing, you'll find me in the realm of Web Development. 💻

Why code? To understand my dev team better, uncover the tech behind products, and add a little bit more techie ⚡ to my PM skills.

Though coding is currently a hobby, I embrace my amateur status with curiosity and eagerness to learn. Here, you'll find my projects. They might be small, but each is created with a spirit of exploration and a fair share of `console.log()` statements. 😅

Remember, in a world where you can be anything, be the **Product Manager who codes**! Or at least tries... Catch you on the `commit` side. 💪 

P.S. If you don't find me here, I'm probably sipping a Caipirinha on a beach somewhere! 🍹
